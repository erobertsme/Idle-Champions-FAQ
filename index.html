These codes are predominantly only available for a limited time, commonly around 24 or 48 hours from the broadcast.

              <div class="col">
                The following is a list of commonly used terms which may be unfamiliar to new players:<br /><br />
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li><b>AoE/Area of Effect</b><br />
                      This refers to attacks that target an enemy and hit the enemies in an area around the target. It is commonly also used to refer to attacks that hit multiple enemies, even when they are not 'technically' AoEs and instead are multi-attacks.<br />
                          An example of an AoE attack is be Makos' Ultimate attack<br />
                          An example of a multi-attack is Asharra's basic attack
                  </li><br />
                  <li><b>CNE</b><br />
                      CNE stands for Codename Entertainment. CNE are the developers behind Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms, as well as many other games, including the very popular Clicker game: Crusaders of the Lost Idols.
                  </li><br />
                  <li><b>CotLI</b><br />
                      Crusaders of the Lost Idols is another Clicker developed by CNE, and has been a favourite game for many of the Idle Champions community members. Since CNE developed both games, and they are both clickers, they are often compared by the playerbase.
                  </li><br />
                  <li><b>Distractions</b><br />
                      This is a term used to refer to the background animations that can be clicked to gain a small amount of gold. <br />
                      Currently there are 3 different types of Distraction:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Birds/Crows</li>
                        <li>Goblins/Bushes</li>
                        <li>Wobbly Stones</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li><br />
                  <li><b>DPS</b><br />
                      Damage Per Second: Usually used when refferencing your Formation's DPS value, listed in the top left corner of the game window next to the Sword on a Blue Banner.
                      It is worth noting that Debuffs from your Champions (e.g. Minsc's Favoured Enemy) are not included in the displayed DPS. Similarly, Barrowin's Blessed Hammer Damage boost is not represented in the displayed DPS value either. As such, the debuff or Blessed Hammer abilities don't contribute towards anything based on your group DPS (e.g. Offline Gold, Contract Gold, Firebreath Potions).
                  </li><br />
                  <li><b>FE/Favoured Enemy</b><br />
                      This refers to Minsc's 'Favoured Enemy' ability to choose a type of creature and have them take increased damage from your party.
                  </li><br />
                  <li><b>GF/Gold Find</b><br />
                      Gold Find is a multiplier to the amount of gold obtained from any source (enemy, contract, distraction, chest). Your base Gold Find is calculated based on your Favour within a Campaign, however some Champions are able to increase this Gold Find via their abilities.
                          Jarlaxe has multiple Upgrades that increase the party's Gold Find whilt he is in the formation.
                          Makos has a specialisation option that increases the Gold found when he lands the killing blow on an enemy.
                          Stoki has an Upgrade that increases the Gold found when someone kills an enemy she has attacked.
                      Jarlaxe's Upgrades affect your overall Gold Find, where as both Stoki and Makos affect specific enemies. The extra Gold dropped due to both Stoki and Makos' abilities are dropped as Platinum Pieces.
                  </li><br />
                  <li><b>Primary DPS</b><br />
                      Used to refer to your main damage dealing Champion. Due to the way the game's systems work currently, focusing all your buffs on the 'Primary DPS' is the most optimal method for creating a Formation. The damage of the other Champions is negligible.
                          The development team is currently working on an "Update to health, healing, and tanking specs to make tanking a more viable alternative" as well as "A major rebalancing patch to address the extreme variation in damage between your main dps and your other champions (after tanking/healing is fixed)".
                  </li><br />
                  <li><b>RaF</b><br />
                      This is an acronym for Refer a Friend. Which refers to (currently two) Weekend Events, that have been held. During the events, each account was given 5 RaF codes, to give to friends. If any of their friends completed set goals, both accounts received rewards. The most notable reward, for the final goal, has been a fixed All Champion Damage Shiny.
                          The first RaF Event rewarded Celeste's Shiny Basic Gauntlets.
                          The second RaF Event rewarded Hitch's Shiny Ugly Slippers.
                  </li><br />
                  <li><b>Wall</b><br />
                      This is a term used to refer to the highest zone you can reach (with a specific formation on a specific mission). In general, as you progress in the game, your wall increases.
                  </li><br />
                  <li><b>Z___ or L___ (Z200 or L200)</b><br />
                      Z or L followed by a number are common methods of referring to specific Zones (also called Levels) of a mission. Z200 would refer to the 200th Zone in a mission.

                You can play the campaigns in whichever order you like, and do bits of both interchangeably if you want to. However, if you wish to be more optimal with your Campaign order choice, the most valuable reward for progressing within Permanent Campaigns is the ability to purchase Global Blessings. However, in order to both progress to higher Zones (allowing faster Gold, and therefore Favour, earnings), and to unlock the higher Teir Blessings, you much purchase a minimum number of Blessings of the lower Tiers. By default, a Warning is turned on within Idle Champions that will trigger if you attempt to spend more than 20% of your current Favour, which is rarely advisable to ignore.<br />
                Due to difference Global Blessings being available for each Permanent Campaign, and set at different Favour Costs, there is a generally agreed upon best order to progress when purchasing these Global Blessings:
                <br /><br />
                <b>Grand Tour of the Sword Coast (Torm) - Tier 1 (T1) Global Blessing - Double Damage</b><br />
                Additionally, buying the 'Divine Blessing' T1 Torm Blessing when the cost of it is <=2% of the favour gained on your run will gain you more than it costs to purchase.
                <br /><br />
                <b>Tomb of Annihilation (Kelemvor) - T2 Global Blessing - Legendary Champions</b><br />
                  Similar to the T1 Torm Blessing 'Divine Blessing', 'Golden Riches' is worth buying when its cost <=20% of the favour gained on your run, as it will increase your gained Favour by more than it costs to purchase.
                <br /><br />
                <b>Grand Tour of the Sword Coast (Torm) - T2 Global Blessing - Gem Hunter</b><br />
                'Heavy Hitters' is a much better investment than 'Quick Hitters'. The vast majority of Primary DPS Champions have Base Attack cooldowns of more than 4 seconds, therefore 'Heavy Hitters' benefits your important damage dealing Champions the most.
                  <br /><br />
                <b>Tomb of Annihilation (Kelemvor) - T2&amp;T3 Global Blessing - Temporary Worship & Golden Luck</b><br />
                'Womanly Wiles' is better than Showmanship if you use a Female as your Primary DPS. Visa-versa, 'Showmanship' if better than Womanly Wiles if you use a Male as your Primary DPS.

                First, check the <a href="https://discord.gg/KqS65JG">#glitches_bugs</a> discord channel, and see if anyone has recently reported the bug you are experiencing. It could be a common thing that is known, and potential specific solutions easily found there.
                <br /><br />
                If you can't find a similar bug reported recently, post the bug (including screenshots if relevant) to the <a href="https://discord.gg/KqS65JG">#glitches_bugs</a> discord channel. This allows both the other players (who might have ideas about how to help you fix it) as well as the developers be aware of the bug.
                <br /><br />
                In addition to posting in the <a href="https://discord.gg/KqS65JG">#glitches_bugs</a> discord channel, submit a ticket in game. This option can be found Esc>Support>Okay. This will open up the webpage for your support tickets. You can submit the report there, though do check to see if it is already listed as there is advice for some common issues there.<br /><br />
                After taking the above steps, try the following until something works:<br />
                <ol>
                  <li>Closing, and reopening your game. Many issues can be solved quickly by doing this.</li>
                  <li>Closing the game and then Validating your local files.</li>
                    Steam Library>RightClick on Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms>Properties>Local Files>Verify Integrity of Game Files. Then reopen the game.</li>
                  <li>Close the game and Steam, then attempt to validate the game files again. Sometimes updates with steam are not pushed through to the client sucessfully, and this process usually forces the updates to push through.</li>
                  <li>If none of the above solves your bugs, update your report in both #glitches_bugs and in your support ticket, which can be accessed by the same Esc>Support method as before, so that the devs are aware that the issue is not simply fixed by resetting things.</li>
                  <li>If one of the above worked, update your report in both #glitches_bugs and in your support ticket, which can be accessed by the same Esc>Support method as before, so that the devs are aware that the issue is fixed by resetting things.</li>

                It is possible to create a shortcut to validate the local files of any steam game. The following instructions are for windows (though it should be possible to do something similar on other operating systems).<br />
                <ul>
                  <li>RightClick in the folder you want the shortcut (or on your Desktop)</li>
                  <li>Select New>Shortcut</li>
                  <li>In the 'Location of the item' text box, paste the following: steam://validate/627690
                    <ul>
                      <li>steam://validate/ tells your operating system to tell Steam to begin validating the SteamID that follows.</li>
                      <li>627690 is the SteamID of Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Click 'Next'</li>
                  <li>Enter the name you wish to use for the Shortcut</li>
                  <li>Click 'Finish'</li>
                </ul>
                Now you should have a blank looking shortcut that will validate your Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms files when used. You can change the icon for the Shortcut if you wish by doing the following:<br />
                <ul>
                  <li>RichtClick the shortcut</li>
                  <li>Go to the 'Web Document' tab</li>
                  <li>Click 'Change Icon...'</li>
                </ul>
                  You can either select one of the default Windows icons for the shortcut and click 'OK', or use the Idle Champions logo by doing the following:
                <ul>
                  <li>Click 'Browse'</li>
                  <li>Navigate to your Idle Champions installation location
                    <ul><li>Typically found in: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\IdleChampions</li></ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Select 'IdleDragons.exe'</li>
                  <li>Click 'Open'</li>
                  <li>Click 'OK'</li>
                  <li>Click 'OK'</li>
                </ul>
                And now you have a Shortcut to validate your Idle Champions steam files with the Idle Champions logo for an icon.

                All creatures in Idle Champions take their 'type' from the official 5e D&amp;D material. As such, in order to find out what type a creature type an enemy is, you can simply search for the creature on D&amp;D Beyond's Beastiary (https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters) and see the creature's Type.
                <br /><br />

                <ul>
                  <li>Common (White)</li>

                The higher Rarity gear provides a larger boost to the equipment. Common, Uncommon, and Rare equipment are obtainable through Silver Chests, however the chances for a Rare drop in a Silver chest is very low. Gold Chests guarantee at least one Rare or better drop, and no drops of a lesser rarity than Uncommon (i.e. no Common drops). Note that a drop includes Contracts and Potions not just Equipment, so it is possible to open a Gold Chest and get no Rare Equipment from it.

                Shiny and Gold are 'Gilds' act as a seperate rarity system to the regular Common/Uncommon/Rare/Epicv rarities. Because they exist on a seperate system, upgrading an equipment's rarity keeps the Gild of the item.
                <br /><br />
                A Gold Gilded card can (currently) only be obtained through purchase of Normal Chests within the ingame Store (which will reward a Gold Epic Axe for Bruenor), purchase of Event Chests (which will reward a Specific Gold Epic Item for the Event Champion), purchasing a Weekend Event Chest (which will rewards a Specific Gold Epic Item for one of the Weekend Champions), or by purchasing one of the DLCs, which each grant a Specific Gold Epic Item for the Champion in the DLC.
                <br /><br />
                A Shiny Gilded card can be found in any Chest (at roughly 0.1% chance per Equipment Card Drop), or via a form of Fixed Acquisition. The first method of Fixed Acquisition that was implemented was a temporary 'Refer a Friend Weekend Event', which has now been run twice. The first of these RaF Weekends rewarded the player with up to 5 Shiny Gauntlets for Celeste, and the second rewarded up to 5 Shiny Boots for Hitch. The second method of Fixed Acquisition for Shiny Gilded items (the only constantly available method), if that of purchasing Gold Chests from the in game shop. When spending $10 or more in a single transaction, the player will be Guaranteed to receive 1 Shiny Gilded card, per $10 spent in the transaction, within random chests from the purchase.
                <br /><br />
                It is only possible to get a duplicate shiny when receiving a Shiny through Fixed Acquisition, where the pool of Shiny casrds available no longer has any options that would not be a duplicate Shiny for the account obtaining them. Duplicate Shiny Gilded cards grant the normal level boost to an item, based solely on the duplicate's Rarity. Therefore, a Duplicate Shiny Common will only grant an additional +1 Level to a piece of gear.
                <br /><br />
                Shiny gear can be upgraded to Gold, however a Gold upgraded from a Shiny provides the same boost as a Gold that was never Shiny.
                <br /><br />
                    A Shiny piece of equipment (silver border) will permanently increase the effect of the equipment slot by 50%.<br />
                    A Gold piece of equipment (gold border) will permanently increase the effect of the equipment slot by 100%.<br />

                The letters you will see by default are a system called 'Number and Word' notation. It is based on ancient Greek terms used for representing large numbers (m = million, q = quintillion, etc.). However, when these values get past a fairly early point, it becomes difficult for the majority of people to know what number is being represented.
                <br /><br />
                The simple solution to this is to enable Scientific Notation, which is found under Esc>Settings>General>Scientific Notation. Scientific notation (called Standard Notation in the Uk and some other countries) is as the names suggest, the standard notation used in scientific fields. It is also a very intuitive method for figuring out which is larger when dealing with multiple very large numbers.
                <br /><br />
                Standard form, or standard index form, is a system of writing numbers which can be particularly useful for working with very large or very small numbers. It is based on using powers of 10 to express how big or small a number is.
                <br /><br />
                Standard form is written in the form of Equation: AeN, where: A is a number bigger than or equal to 1 and less than 10, and N is the number of places that would appear after the deicmal place when written in normal form.
                <br /><br />
                For example: 3.1e12 = 3,100,000,000,000 = 3.1 trillion = 3.1t

                You should use whichever formation you enjoy using the most. However, if the formation you enjoy the most is the most optimal formation for you, that is dependant upon your gear. As such, there is no 'Best Formation' that will be the best for everyone.<br /><br />
                There are however, some key aspects to formation building that will help maximise your ability to push to higher Zones.
                <br /><br />
                1) Focus all youer Buffing Champions onto a single high damage Champion - Your Primary DPS<br />
                2) Pick specialisations that boost damage, not tanking/healing. (This will change in the future once the 'Tanking and Healing' Update happens)

                Some Champions (Calliope, Dhadius, and Birdsong currently) have abilities that only affect Champions within a certain range of themself. This range <i>must</i> be a tracable path from the buffer to the target along slots where Champions can be placed, except when the ability states "as the crow flies" (currently only Dhadius). In layouts where there is a gap in the formation (such as the Grand Revel Event Formation Layout) the 'hole' in the formation does <i>not</i> count as a slot. Meaning that the path between the two Champions must be traced around the 'hole' (for Birdsong and Calliope). However, in Variant Missions where NPCs are taking up a Slot in your Formation, these Slots are still part of the Layout and can be used for the path between the two Champions (for all three Champions abilities).

                Due to the new 'Guaranteed Upgrade' Mechanics of the 'Chests and Potions Update' the ideal order to buy/open chests for an Event Champion is as follows:
                <br /><br />
                If you are going to buy <i>any</i> chests, buy at least some of them first<br />
                <ul>
                  <li>Open ONE Gold Event Chest</li>
                  <li>Open Silver Event Chests until All slots are Rare(Blue)+ OR until the Event is over and you are unable to obtain anymore Silver Event Chests</li>
                  <li>Open Gold Event Chests</li>
                </ul>
                The above is the ideal method for opening Event Chests, however it is extremely unlikely for anyone to obtain all Blue+ Equipment from Silver Chests alone, due to their very low drop rate. As such, realistically, there is only a <i>very marginal</i> detriment to opening <i>exclusively</i> Silver Event Chests until all the Equipment is Uncommon(Green)+, and then move onto opening Golds and Silvers once they are obtained. The following order takes this into account:
                <br /><br />
                If you are going to buy <i>any</i> chests, buy at least some of them first<br />

                  <li>Open ONE Gold Event Chest</li>
