    "question": "What does _____ mean?",
    "answer": "The following is a list of commonly used terms which may be unfamiliar to new players:<br /><br />\n<ul class=\"list-unstyled\">\n<li><b>AoE/Area of Effect</b><br />\nThis refers to attacks that target an enemy and hit the enemies in an area around the target. It is commonly also used to refer to attacks that hit multiple enemies, even when they are not 'technically' AoEs and instead are multi-attacks.<br />\nAn example of an AoE attack is be Makos' Ultimate attack<br />\nAn example of a multi-attack is Asharra's basic attack\n</li><br />\n<li><b>CNE</b><br />\nCNE stands for Codename Entertainment. CNE are the developers behind Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms, as well as many other games, including the very popular Clicker game: Crusaders of the Lost Idols.\n</li><br />\n<li><b>CotLI</b><br />\nCrusaders of the Lost Idols is another Clicker developed by CNE, and has been a favourite game for many of the Idle Champions community members. Since CNE developed both games, and they are both clickers, they are often compared by the playerbase.\n</li><br />\n<li><b>Distractions</b><br />\nThis is a term used to refer to the background animations that can be clicked to gain a small amount of gold. <br />\nCurrently there are 3 different types of Distraction:\n<ul>\n<li>Birds/Crows</li>\n<li>Goblins/Bushes</li>\n<li>Wobbly Stones</li>\n</ul>\n</li><br />\n<li><b>DPS</b><br />\nDamage Per Second: Usually used when refferencing your Formation's DPS value, listed in the top left corner of the game window next to the Sword on a Blue Banner.\nIt is worth noting that Debuffs from your Champions (e.g. Minsc's Favoured Enemy) are not included in the displayed DPS. Similarly, Barrowin's Blessed Hammer Damage boost is not represented in the displayed DPS value either. As such, the debuff or Blessed Hammer abilities don't contribute towards anything based on your group DPS (e.g. Offline Gold, Contract Gold, Firebreath Potions).\n</li><br />\n<li><b>FE/Favoured Enemy</b><br />\nThis refers to Minsc's 'Favoured Enemy' ability to choose a type of creature and have them take increased damage from your party.\n</li><br />\n<li><b>GF/Gold Find</b><br />\nGold Find is a multiplier to the amount of gold obtained from any source (enemy, contract, distraction, chest). Your base Gold Find is calculated based on your Favour within a Campaign, however some Champions are able to increase this Gold Find via their abilities.\nJarlaxe has multiple Upgrades that increase the party's Gold Find whilt he is in the formation.\nMakos has a specialisation option that increases the Gold found when he lands the killing blow on an enemy.\nStoki has an Upgrade that increases the Gold found when someone kills an enemy she has attacked.\nJarlaxe's Upgrades affect your overall Gold Find, where as both Stoki and Makos affect specific enemies. The extra Gold dropped due to both Stoki and Makos' abilities are dropped as Platinum Pieces.\n</li><br />\n<li><b>Primary DPS</b><br />\nUsed to refer to your main damage dealing Champion. Due to the way the game's systems work currently, focusing all your buffs on the 'Primary DPS' is the most optimal method for creating a Formation. The damage of the other Champions is negligible.\nThe development team is currently working on an &quot;Update to health, healing, and tanking specs to make tanking a more viable alternative&quot; as well as &quot;A major rebalancing patch to address the extreme variation in damage between your main dps and your other champions (after tanking/healing is fixed)&quot;.\n</li><br />\n<li><b>RaF</b><br />\nThis is an acronym for Refer a Friend. Which refers to (currently two) Weekend Events, that have been held. During the events, each account was given 5 RaF codes, to give to friends. If any of their friends completed set goals, both accounts received rewards. The most notable reward, for the final goal, has been a fixed All Champion Damage Shiny.\nThe first RaF Event rewarded Celeste's Shiny Basic Gauntlets.\nThe second RaF Event rewarded Hitch's Shiny Ugly Slippers.\n</li><br />\n<li><b>Wall</b><br />\nThis is a term used to refer to the highest zone you can reach (with a specific formation on a specific mission). In general, as you progress in the game, your wall increases.\n</li><br />\n<li><b>Z___ or L___ (e.g. Z200 or L200)</b><br />\nZ or L followed by a number are common methods of referring to specific Zones (also called Levels) of a mission. Z200 would refer to the 200th Zone in a mission.\n</li><br />\n<li><b>T_ (e.g. T3)</b><br />\nT_ refers to the Tiers of Blessings within the Blessings tab.<br />Currently there are three Tiers of Blessings, T1, T2, and T3 Blessings.<br /><br />Most commonly discussed along with the use of this shorthand are the Global Blessings within each Tier, commonly referred to as 'the T_ Global' or 'T_GB'.\n</li><br />\n<li><b>GB</b><br />\nWithin the Blessings of Idle Champions, there are two primary types of Blessings.\n<ul>\n<li>Core Blessings - Three per Tier</li>\n<li>Global Blessings - One per Tier</li></ul><br />Core Blessings *only* affect the Campaign for which the Blessing originates from, where as 'Global' Blessings affect a number of different Campaigns, most of which affect *all* Campaigns, which is why they are referred to as 'Global' Blessings.\n</li><br />\n<li><b>AGT/AGTotSW/Sword Coast</b><br />\nA Grand Tour of the Sword Coast is the first Permanent Campaign featured in Idle Champions.<br />The Grand Tour of the Sword Coast Campaign features a single map area, its namesake The Sword Coast.\n</li><br />\n<li><b>ToA/Tomb</b><br />\nTomb of Annihilation is the second Permanent Campaign featured in Idle Champions.<br />The Tomb of Annihilation Campaign features two different map areas:\n<ul>\n<li>The Sword Coast</li>\n<li>Chult</li></ul>\n</li></ul>"

    "question": "Which Campaign should I do first? Should I stick to just one Campaign or do both together?",
    "answer": "You can play the campaigns in whichever order you like, and do bits of both interchangeably if you want to. However, if you wish to be more optimal with your Campaign order choice, the most valuable reward for progressing within Permanent Campaigns is the ability to purchase Global Blessings. However, in order to both progress to higher Zones (allowing faster Gold, and therefore Favour earnings), and to unlock the higher Teir Blessings, you much purchase a minimum number of Blessings of the lower Tiers. By default, a Warning is turned on within Idle Champions that will trigger if you attempt to spend more than 1% of your current Favour, and showing the percentage amount about to be spent when it is 10%+, it is often wise to adhere to this 10% Favour spending warning.<br />\nDue to difference Global Blessings being available for each Permanent Campaign, and set at different Favour Costs, there is a generally agreed upon best order to progress when purchasing these Global Blessings:<br /><br /><b>Grand Tour of the Sword Coast (Torm) - Tier 1 (T1) Global Blessing - Double Damage</b><br />Additionally, buying the 'Divine Blessing' T1 Torm Blessing when the cost of it is <=2% of the favour gained on your run will gain you more than it costs to purchase.<br /><br /><b>Tomb of Annihilation (Kelemvor) - T1 Global Blessing - Legendary Champions</b><br />Similar to the T1 Torm Blessing 'Divine Blessing', 'Golden Riches' is worth buying when its cost <=20% of the favour gained on your run, as it will increase your gained Favour by more than it costs to purchase.<br /><br /><b>Grand Tour of the Sword Coast (Torm) - T2 Global Blessing - Gem Hunter</b><br />'Heavy Hitters' is a much better investment than 'Quick Hitters'. The vast majority of Primary DPS Champions have Base Attack cooldowns of more than 4 seconds, therefore 'Heavy Hitters' benefits your important damage dealing Champions the most.<br /><br /><b>Tomb of Annihilation (Kelemvor) - T2&amp;T3 Global Blessing - Temporary Worship & Golden Luck</b><br />'Womanly Wiles' is better than Showmanship if you use a Female as your Primary DPS. Visa-versa, 'Showmanship' if better than Womanly Wiles if you use a Male as your Primary DPS."

    "question": "I have a bug, what do I do?",
    "answer": "First, check the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://discord.gg/IdleChampions\">#glitches_bugs</a> discord channel, and see if anyone has recently reported the bug you are experiencing. It could be a common occurance that is known about, and potential solutions can sometimes be easily found there.<br /><br />If you can't find a similar bug reported recently, post the bug (including screenshots if relevant) to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://discord.gg/IdleChampions\">#glitches_bugs</a> discord channel.

This option can be found via: Esc>Support>Okay. This will open up the webpage for your support tickets. You can submit the report there, though do check to see if it is already listed as there is advice for some common issues there.<br /><br />After taking the above steps, try the following until something works:<br /><ol><li>Closing, and reopening your game.

    "question": "Which FE should I pick?",
    "answer": "In general, it is best to wait until you reach your wall or know what the enemy type at your wall is before selecting a Minsc/Zorbu FE specialisation. You can leave Minsc at level 50/Zorbu at level 10 with his Specilisation unpicked until you get to the wall."

    "question": "How do I know what type the enemy is (for choosing the best FE)?",
    "answer": "All creatures in Idle Champions take their 'type' from the official 5e D&amp;D material. As such, in order to find out what type a creature type an enemy is, you can simply search for the creature on D&amp;D Beyond's Beastiary (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/\">https:www.dndbeyond.com/monsters</a>) and see the creature's Type.<br /><br />Alternatively, most missions have had the enemies in them documented (though when new content is released it takes time to document them) in the Idle Champions wikia (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://idle-champions.wikia.com/\">http://idle-champions.wikia.com/</a>) or for events Gaarawar's Event Guides (which can be found linked in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://discord.gg/IdleChampions\">#resources</a> Discord channel) usually list the enemies type for each level."

    "question": "Mission _____ says it's 'Fair' but I can't complete it/Mission _____ says it's 'Challenging' but it was super easy, what's going on with the difficulty ratings?",
    "answer": "The difficulty ratings for missions displayed in the game are intended as rough guides, however they are often inaccurate at predicting the difficulty of a mission because they are based solely on your Campaign Favour, and do not take into account Blessings or Temporary Buffs that you may have active at the time."

    "question": "What are the Equipment Rarities?",
    "answer": "The 4 Rarities of equipment are:<br /><ul><li>Common (White)</li><li>Uncommon (Green)</li><li>Rare (Blue)</li><li>Epic (Purple)</li></ul>The higher Rarity gear provides a larger boost to the equipment. Common, Uncommon, and Rare equipment are obtainable through Silver Chests, however the chances for a Rare drop in a Silver chest is very low. Gold Chests guarantee at least one Rare or better drop, and no drops of a lesser rarity than Uncommon (i.e. no Common drops). Note that a drop includes Contracts and Potions not just Equipment, so it is possible to open a Gold Chest and get no Rare Equipment from it.<br /><br />More detailed information about Equipment Rarity specifics can be found on the wikia: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://idle-champions.wikia.com/wiki/Equipment\">http://idle-champions.wikia.com/wiki/Equipment</a>"

    "question": "What is a Shiny/Gold, and what does it do?",
    "answer": "Shiny and Gold are 'Gilds' act as a seperate rarity system to the regular Common/Uncommon/Rare/Epic rarities. Because they exist on a seperate system, upgrading an equipment's rarity keeps the Gild of the item.<br /><br />A Gold Gilded card can (currently) only be obtained through purchase of Normal Chests within the ingame Store (which will reward a Gold Epic Axe for Bruenor), purchase of Event Chests (which will reward a Specific Gold Epic Item for the Event Champion), purchasing a Weekend Event Chest (which will rewards a Specific Gold Epic Item for one of the Weekend Champions), or by purchasing one of the DLCs, which each grant a Specific Gold Epic Item for the Champion in the DLC.<br /><br />A Shiny Gilded card can be found in any Chest (0.1% chance per Equipment Card Drop), or via a form of Fixed Acquisition. The first method of Fixed Acquisition that was implemented was a temporary 'Refer a Friend Weekend Event', which has now been run twice. The first of these RaF Weekends rewarded the player with up to 5 Shiny Gauntlets for Celeste, and the second rewarded up to 5 Shiny Boots for Hitch. The second method of Fixed Acquisition for Shiny Gilded items (the only constantly available method), if that of purchasing Gold Chests from the in game shop. When spending $10 or more in a single transaction, the player will be Guaranteed to receive 1 Shiny Gilded card, per $10 spent in the transaction, within random chests from the purchase.<br /><br />It is only possible to get a duplicate shiny when receiving a Shiny through Fixed Acquisition, where the pool of Shiny casrds available no longer has any options that would not be a duplicate Shiny for the account obtaining them. Duplicate Shiny Gilded cards grant the normal level boost to an item, based solely on the duplicate's Rarity. Therefore, a Duplicate Shiny Common will only grant an additional +1 Level to a piece of gear.<br /><br />Shiny gear can be upgraded to Gold, however a Gold upgraded from a Shiny provides the same boost as a Gold that was never Shiny.<br /><br />A Shiny piece of equipment (silver border) will permanently increase the effect of the equipment slot by 50%.<br />A Gold piece of equipment (gold border) will permanently increase the effect of the equipment slot by 100%.<br /><br />More detailed information about Equipment Gild specifics can be found on the wikia: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://idle-champions.wikia.com/wiki/Equipment\">http://idle-champions.wikia.com/wiki/Equipment</a>"

    "question": "How do I know how much Gold I have/DPS I'm doing? What does 15.4Q mean?",
    "answer": "The letters you will see by default are a system called 'Number and Word' notation. It is based on ancient Greek terms used for representing large numbers (m = million, q = quintillion, etc.). However, when these values get past a fairly early point, it becomes difficult for the majority of people to know what number is being represented.<br /><br />The simple solution to this is to enable Scientific Notation, which is found under Esc>Settings>General>Scientific Notation. Scientific notation (called Standard Notation in the Uk and some other countries) is as the names suggest, the standard notation used in scientific fields. It is also a very intuitive method for figuring out which is larger when dealing with multiple very large numbers.<br /><br />Standard form, or standard index form, is a system of writing numbers which can be particularly useful for working with very large or very small numbers. It is based on using powers of 10 to express how big or small a number is.<br /><br />Standard form is written in the form of Equation: AeN, where: A is a number bigger than or equal to 1 and less than 10, and N is the number of places that would appear after the deicmal place when written in normal form.<br /><br />For example: 3.1e12 = 3,100,000,000,000 = 3.1 trillion = 3.1t"

    "id": "16",
    "question": "What Formation should I use?",
    "answer": "You should use whichever formation you enjoy using the most. However, if the formation you enjoy the most is the most optimal formation for you, that is dependant upon your gear. As such, there is no 'Best Formation' that will be the best for everyone.<br /><br />There are however, some key aspects to formation building that will help maximise your ability to push to higher Zones.<br /><br />1) Focus all youer Buffing Champions onto a single high damage Champion - Your Primary DPS<br />2) Pick specialisations that boost damage, not tanking/healing. (This will change in the future once the 'Tanking and Healing' Update happens)<br /><br />There is a recently created GitHub repository where community can upload their formations and can tag them and such: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/davoodinator/CTFRDOC/tree/master/Formations\">https://github.com/davoodinator/CTFRDOC/tree/master/Formations</a><br />This link can be found in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://discord.gg/IdleChampions\">#resources</a> Discord channel.<br /><br />Additionally, you can find Archimedes' personal formations, for both Permanent Campaigns and Event Campaigns, which includes a large space where anyone is free to put their own formations at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://app.roll20.net/join/3033910/Gv8thA\">https://app.roll20.net/join/3033910/Gv8thA</a><br /><br />If you wish for more indepth help with optimising your formation and understanding the formation mechanics more thouroughly, you should head into <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://discord.gg/IdleChampions\">#formations in Discord</a> and ask, plenty of knowledgeable players are more than happy to help others improve their formations and widen their knowledge."

    "question": "Can I save my progress and play on various PCs?",

    "question": "Offline Gold gains, why are they so bad?",
    "answer": "Because reasons. Just don't use them.<br /><br />Justin (CNE's Lead Developer) is working on improving the offline Gold gain calculations to better approximate online Gold gains. Due to Contract, Chest, and Distraction Gold all being based on Offline Gold gains, they will improve when Offline Gold gains improve."

    "id": "19",
    "question": "What does it mean when an ability requires a Champion to be 'within 2 slots' of them?",
    "answer": "Some Champions (Calliope, Dhadius, and Birdsong currently) have abilities that only affect Champions within a certain range of themself. This range <i>must</i> be a tracable path from the buffer to the target along slots where Champions can be placed, except when the ability states &quot;as the crow flies&quot; (currently only Dhadius). In layouts where there is a gap in the formation (such as the Grand Revel Event Formation Layout) the 'hole' in the formation does <i>not</i> count as a slot. Meaning that the path between the two Champions must be traced around the 'hole' (for Birdsong and Calliope). However, in Variant Missions where NPCs are taking up a Slot in your Formation, these Slots are still part of the Layout and can be used for the path between the two Champions (for all three Champions abilities)."

    "id": "20",
    "question": "What's the best order to open Event Chests?",
    "answer": "Due to the new 'Guaranteed Upgrade' Mechanics of the 'Chests and Potions Update' the <i>ideal</i> order to buy/open chests for an Event Champion is as follows:<br /><br />If you are going to buy <i>any</i> chests, buy at least some of them first (this prevents wasting drops from being replaced by a guaranteed Golden Epic)<br /><ul><li>If you are not going to buy <i>any</i> chests, open ONE Gold Event Chest</li><li>Open Silver Event Chests until All slots are Rare(Blue)+</li><li>Open Gold Event Chests</li></ul>The above is the <i>ideal</i> method for opening Event Chests, however it is extremely unlikely for anyone to obtain all Blue+ Equipment from Silver Chests alone, due to their very low drop rate, and the time restricted manner of Events. As such, realistically, there is only a <i>very marginal</i> detriment to opening <i>exclusively</i> Silver Event Chests until all the Equipment is Uncommon(Green)+, and then move onto opening Golds and Silvers as they are obtained. The following order takes this into account:<br /><br />If you are going to buy <i>any</i> chests, buy at least some of them first (this prevents wasting drops from being replaced by a guaranteed Golden Epic)<br /><ul><li>If you are not going to buy <i>any</i> chests, open ONE Gold Event Chest</li><li>Open Silver Event Chests until All slots are Uncommon(Green)+ <i>or</i> until the Event is over and you are unable to obtain anymore Silver Event Chests</li><li>Open Gold Event Chests</li></ul>"

    "question": "How does the guaranteed 1 Epic Equipment per 10 Gold Chests work?",
    "answer": "The guaranteed Epic Equipment card within every 10 Gold Chests applies to each type of Gold Chest independently of one another. Each type of Chest has a unique image, although 'Event Chest' is often used to categorise chests, the pity timer is specific to the Type of Event Chest.<br />\nFor example, if you open 9 Grand Revel (Event) Gold Chests and then you open 1 Fleetswake (Event) Gold Chest, you are not Guaranteed an Epic Equipment Card in the Fleetswake Chest. However, if you open 10 Fleetswake Chests, you are guaranteed at least 1 Epic Equipment Card.<br /><br />\nNote: This Guaranteed Epic is a Guaranteed Epic <i>Equipment</i> Card, getting an Epic Consumable does <i>not</i> affect the 1 Guaranteed Epic Equipment Card per 10 Gold Chests"

    "question": "Do Newsletter Chest Codes Expire similarly to other Chest Codes? How long do they last?",
    "answer": "No, Newsletter Chest Codes never Expire. They are also not bound to a specific account, however each code can only be used once (by a single account).<br /><br />\n\nBecause of this, it is possible, if you were to sign up to the Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms Newsletter before playing, or given codes that were sent out before you began playing the game, to have a vast number of free chests from Newsletter Codes upon first starting your Idle Champions journey. Providing the codes were not previously used."

    "question": "Should I spend 10k Event Tokens on a Gold Event Chest?",
    "answer": "It depends.<br />Because Event Free Plays cost 2.5k Event Tokens to run, 10k Event Tokens could either pay for 1 Guaranteed Gold Event Chest, or 4 Free Plays.<br />Justin has confirmed that there is a 33.33% chance of getting a Gold Event Chest, and therefore a 66.66% chance of getting a Silver Event Chest, from an Event Free Play (Past Z50).<br /><br />Since there is a 33.33% chance of getting a Gold Event Chest from the Free Play, and you can get 4 Free Plays with 10k Event Tokens. Due to this, there is slightly over an 80% chance that 10k Event Tokens will grant at least one Gold Event Chest through Free Plays. It also has the potential to grant more than one Gold Event Chest (slightly over 40% chance).<br /><br />So, statistically, it is unwise to spend 10k Event Tokens on a single Gold Event Chest, however there are some influencing factors that could make buying a Gold Event Chest for 10k Event Tokens more favourable:<br /><br /><ul><li>Time constraints: Completing 4 Free Play runs to Z50 takes time (~30mins per run)</li><li>There is a ~20% chance to get zero Gold Event Chests from the 4 Free Plays</li></ul>"
