      "question": "What does _____ mean?",
      "answer": "The following is a list of commonly used terms which may be unfamiliar to new players:<br \/><br \/>\n<ul class=\"list-unstyled\">\n<li><b>AoE\/Area of Effect<\/b><br \/>\nThis refers to attacks that target an enemy and hit the enemies in an area around the target. It is commonly also used to refer to attacks that hit multiple enemies, even when they are not 'technically' AoEs and instead are multi-attacks.<br \/>\nAn example of an AoE attack is be Makos' Ultimate attack<br \/>\nAn example of a multi-attack is Asharra's basic attack\n<\/li><br \/>\n<li><b>CNE<\/b><br \/>\nCNE stands for Codename Entertainment. CNE are the developers behind Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms, as well as many other games, including the very popular Clicker game: Crusaders of the Lost Idols.\n<\/li><br \/>\n<li><b>CotLI<\/b><br \/>\nCrusaders of the Lost Idols is another Clicker developed by CNE, and has been a favourite game for many of the Idle Champions community members. Since CNE developed both games, and they are both clickers, they are often compared by the playerbase.\n<\/li><br \/>\n<li><b>Distractions<\/b><br \/>\nThis is a term used to refer to the background animations that can be clicked to gain a small amount of gold. <br \/>\nCurrently there are 3 different types of Distraction:\n<ul>\n<li>Birds\/Crows<\/li>\n<li>Goblins\/Bushes<\/li>\n<li>Wobbly Stones<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><br \/>\n<li><b>DPS<\/b><br \/>\nDamage Per Second: Usually used when refferencing your Formation's DPS value, listed in the top left corner of the game window next to the Sword on a Blue Banner.\nIt is worth noting that Debuffs from your Champions (e.g. Minsc's Favoured Enemy) are not included in the displayed DPS. Similarly, Barrowin's Blessed Hammer Damage boost is not represented in the displayed DPS value either. As such, the debuff or Blessed Hammer abilities don't contribute towards anything based on your group DPS (e.g. Offline Gold, Contract Gold, Firebreath Potions).\n<\/li><br \/>\n<li><b>FE\/Favoured Enemy<\/b><br \/>\nThis refers to Minsc's 'Favoured Enemy' ability to choose a type of creature and have them take increased damage from your party.\n<\/li><br \/>\n<li><b>GF\/Gold Find<\/b><br \/>\nGold Find is a multiplier to the amount of gold obtained from any source (enemy, contract, distraction, chest). Your base Gold Find is calculated based on your Favour within a Campaign, however some Champions are able to increase this Gold Find via their abilities.\nJarlaxe has multiple Upgrades that increase the party's Gold Find whilt he is in the formation.\nMakos has a specialisation option that increases the Gold found when he lands the killing blow on an enemy.\nStoki has an Upgrade that increases the Gold found when someone kills an enemy she has attacked.\nJarlaxe's Upgrades affect your overall Gold Find, where as both Stoki and Makos affect specific enemies. The extra Gold dropped due to both Stoki and Makos' abilities are dropped as Platinum Pieces.\n<\/li><br \/>\n<li><b>Primary DPS<\/b><br \/>\nUsed to refer to your main damage dealing Champion. Due to the way the game's systems work currently, focusing all your buffs on the 'Primary DPS' is the most optimal method for creating a Formation. The damage of the other Champions is negligible.\nThe development team is currently working on an &quot;Update to health, healing, and tanking specs to make tanking a more viable alternative&quot; as well as &quot;A major rebalancing patch to address the extreme variation in damage between your main dps and your other champions (after tanking\/healing is fixed)&quot;.\n<\/li><br \/>\n<li><b>RaF<\/b><br \/>\nThis is an acronym for Refer a Friend. Which refers to (currently two) Weekend Events, that have been held. During the events, each account was given 5 RaF codes, to give to friends. If any of their friends completed set goals, both accounts received rewards. The most notable reward, for the final goal, has been a fixed All Champion Damage Shiny.\nThe first RaF Event rewarded Celeste's Shiny Basic Gauntlets.\nThe second RaF Event rewarded Hitch's Shiny Ugly Slippers.\n<\/li><br \/>\n<li><b>Wall<\/b><br \/>\nThis is a term used to refer to the highest zone you can reach (with a specific formation on a specific mission). In general, as you progress in the game, your wall increases.\n<\/li><br \/>\n<li><b>Z___ or L___ (Z200 or L200)<\/b><br \/>\nZ or L followed by a number are common methods of referring to specific Zones (also called Levels) of a mission. Z200 would refer to the 200th Zone in a mission.\n<\/li><br \/>\n<\/ul>"
